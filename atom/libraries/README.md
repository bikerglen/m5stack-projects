#Atomic_V1.0-PcbDoc.kicad_pcb

This file is an automatic conversion of the official m5stack altium board to kicad. The original, official altium board design files are located here: https://github.com/m5stack/m5-structural-design-file/blob/master/PCB/Atomic_V1.0.PcbDoc

#m5stack-atom-proto-simple-export.svg

This file is an svg export of the above kicad with many of the board features deleted.

#m5stack-atom-proto-v1.lbr

This eagle pcb file was created using the above svg file. It has a drill file milling cutout between the two screws at the bottom.

#m5stack-atom-proto-v2.lbr
#m5stack-atom-proto-v2-with-header.lbr

These eagle pcb files were derived from the v1 file. The milling cutout is removed since it is not strictly necessary for the board to be compatible with the enclosure. The header version has holes/pads for the included orange pluggable connector header included with the kit. Boards using both of these libraries have been fabbed at OSH Park and verified to fit in the enclosure with the m5stack atom lite mounted to the board using the headers supplied with the proto kit. Note that the boards from OSH Park are 1.6mm thick while the board included with the proto kit is 1.0 mm thick. Everything seems to work OK but a 1 mm thick board might be better if it's an available option.

#m5stack-atom-proto-v3.lbr
#m5stack-atom-proto-v3-with-header.lbr

These eagle pcb files were derived from the v2 files. The milling cutout is removed and the two smaller screw cut outs at the top are removed since they are not strictly necessary for the board to be compatible with the enclosure. The header version has holes/pads for the included orange pluggable connector header included with the kit.
